Most problems are process-related (not people-related)
Low motivation - Do we take regular feedback from software devlopers and their peers?
Lack of skill - Process failure
96% of problems are process related.

For our first project:
- Greenfield
- Everyone co-located
- T&M 
Iteration 0 : First 2 weeks.
	1. Vision
	2. High level architure.
	3. Product backlog - 200 User stories
Iteration 1: 2 weeks.
	- 5 user stories.
	- For these 5: Analysis, Design, Coding, Testing.
	- Output of iteration will be production grade code with 5 features.
Iteration 2: 2 weeks.
	- 4 user stories.
	- For these 4: Analysis, Design, Coding, Unit Testing.
	- For all 9: Integration, system and acceptance testing.
	- Output of iteration will be production grade code with 9 features.
Iteration 3: 2 weeks.
	- 6 user stories.
	- For these 6: Analysis, Design, Coding, Unit Testing.
	- For all 15: Integration, system and acceptance testing.
	- Output of iteration will be production grade code with 15 features.
Answer: Top is Agile, Bottom is Predictive

Choice 1: Predictive, 10 months
Choice 2: Agile
	After 2 months - Static web pages.
	After 5 months - Shopping cart.
	After few more months - Project is complete.


Exercise:
1. Compare Code&Fix with Agile
2. Compare Predictive with Agile


Cycle Time: From the day the customer says this feature is most important, to the day we put the feature in production.


	In last sprint we had 500  hours and we did 20 SPs.
	In next sprint we have 401 hours, we can do 16SPs.s

	In Sprint1, we did 210 SPs.
	In Sprint2, we did 170 SPs.
	In Sprint3, we did 240 SPs.
	Average velocity = 207 SPs.
Question 1) We can do 4 sprints
	Total SPs = 207 SP/sprint * 4 sprints = 828 SPs
	We can do 25 user stories.
Question 2) To do 510SPs, we need 3 sprints
	Time = 3 sprints * 4 weeks/sprint + 2 weeks = 14 weeks.
	Ans) 8-APR
Question 3) To do 1080 SPs, we need 6 sprints
	Time = 6 * 4 + 2 = 26 weeks.
        Ans) No

You want training?
	ScrumMaster will calcualate the cost of training = $500.
	Benefit will be 10% increase in productivity.
	Per sprint we are spending $5000.

Cycle Time:
	1) 4 weeks.
	2) 2 weeks
	3) 2 week / sprint * 10 sprints + 4 weeks = 24 weeks

PO is evaluated based on the profitability of the project.
SM is evaluated based on cycle time and Productivity

Contracts: 
	1) T&M
	2) Rolling contract
	3) Fixed price, fixed duration but variable scope.
	4) Fixed price, fixed duration, fixed scope - Not recommend.
